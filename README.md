# Snake-Game

The Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a snake that moves around the game board, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with itself and the boundaries of the board. As the snake consumes more food, it grows longer, making the game more challenging. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible without causing the snake to collide with itself or the walls.

Features:
1. Classic gameplay inspired by the original Snake game.
2. Responsive controls for maneuvering the snake around the game board.
3. Colorful graphics and visual elements for an engaging gaming experience.
4. Score tracking to keep track of the player's progress and achievements.
5. Game over detection with the ability to restart the game for continuous play.

This Snake game project is implemented in Java using the Swing library for graphical user interface components. It provides an entertaining and nostalgic gaming experience for players of all ages. Enjoy the challenge of guiding the snake to victory while avoiding obstacles and achieving high scores!
